# Text-Classification_Project
### Project given to me in my Machine Learning class where I had to:
1. Convert the given data (spam and non-spam emails in .txt files) into a Bag of Word model and a Bernoulli model.
2. Train a Multinomial Naive Bayes model, Discrete Naive Bayes model, Logistic Regression model, and SGDClassifier Model using the given data.
3. Then write a report comparing the performance (accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score) of these models.

Given data:
